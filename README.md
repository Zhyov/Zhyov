## About me
My name is Fran, but I also go by Luke or Zhyov.

I'm 15 years old, from the Metropolitarian Area of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Knowledge
I know Python, [Luau](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau) and JavaScript. (HTML and CSS too if you consider them programming languages, personally, I don't)

I mainly code in Python and sometimes I make websites. I don't really upload my Luau scripts on GitHub.

Regarding normal languages, I speak Spanish, English and Toki Pona. I also know a little bit of Russian, I'm still learning :)
