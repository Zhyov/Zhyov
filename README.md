## About me
My name is Fran, but I also go by Luke or Zhyov.

I'm 15 years old, from the Metropolitarian Area of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Knowledge
I know Python, Luau (Lua 5.1 for Roblox) and JavaScript. (HTML and CSS too if you consider them programming languages, personally, I don't)

I mainly code in Python and sometimes I make websites. I don't really upload my Luau scripts on GitHub.

Regarding normal languages, I speak Spanish, English and Toki Pona. I also know a little bit of Russian, I'm still learning :)

## Projects
- NTE: Project I'm currently working on, TUI loader and builder. I think of it as my best project.
- HAP: Guide for learning the alphabets of other languages and their pronunciation. My biggest project in file size.

## Extra
Every project I make in Python will use a TUI, can't be bothered to learn tkinter so yeah, don't expect a GUI from any of my projects :P
